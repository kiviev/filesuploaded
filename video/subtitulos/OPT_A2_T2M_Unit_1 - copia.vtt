00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.880
Hi, Max. Hi, JoJo.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.240
- Hi, Evie.
- Hi, Evie.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.600
What's this dance competition
that you want to tell me about?

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.800
It's called The Great Big Dance Slam.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.880
It's in Brighton.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.840
It's on every year in June, isn't it?

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.080
It's going to be great

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.920
dancing with my twin brother
and my best friend.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.440
Yes, I think it's on June the 6th.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.560
Is that right, JoJo?

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.200
So, you want me to dance with you

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.720
but you don't know exactly
when the dance competition is?

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.520
Well, it's always at the weekend,

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.400
and it isn't usually in the holidays,

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.120
but I can't find the letter.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.920
Well,
let's not worry about the letter.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.360
The 6th of June is in two weeks,
we need to start practising and now.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.920
Okay, let's see when we're all free.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.920
So, in my free time

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.240
I go to art club and drama
on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.280
I'm busy on Mondays,
but I'm always free on Thursdays.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.360
and so are you, Evie.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.600
Great,
let's practise on Thursday evenings.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.160
I can't practise on Thursdays.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.240
After school, I have band practice,

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.560
then I often play tennis, sorry.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.400
So we can't practise
on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays,

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.520
and Max is busy on Thursdays.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.200
Well, that still leaves
Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.320
But mum and dad like us
to keep Sundays free for family time.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.880
So let's phone to book the dance studio

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.440
for Friday evening
and Saturday morning

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.240
for the next two weeks.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.280
Okay.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.400
Dance studio, how can I help you?

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.440
Hi, it's Max.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.880
Can we book the dance studio

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.720
for Friday evening
and Saturday morning

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.480
for the next two weeks, please?

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.280
Sorry. What's your surname, Max?

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.040
My surname is Richardson.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.800
How do you spell it, please?

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.840
That's R-I-C-H-A-R-D-S-O-N.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.760
Okay, bye.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.840
Well?

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.480
Well, the good news is
we can rehearse in the dance studio

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.320
on Saturday mornings
from 9:30am to 11:00am.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.480
And the bad news is
we can only rehearse on Saturdays.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.320
Friday night is always Zumba night.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.960
That's three hours of rehearsal
in total, no way.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.080
Right, we need to find
the Dance Slam website.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.280
I'll look for a phone number

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.280
and call them to say
that we can't enter the competition.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.640
What's so funny?

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.360
Listen, "Don't forget, kids,

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.760
the Great Big Dance Slam
is on the 6th of July."

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.240
The competition isn't in June,
it's July.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.440
We've got another month to rehearse.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.440
- Fantastic.
- Great.
